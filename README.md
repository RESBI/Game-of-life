# Game-of-life
It have three version,

C (, Arduino), Python and Java,

I wrote for fun. :)

# Tips:
Arduino version use ssd3306 LCD,or you can change it to other support.

# Result:
After about 4 hour of I start to wrote java version,

I found: In Java, you can't use "\x1b", but "\033".

And "\x1b" have a same meaning with "\033"!(Or "\e")
